# Stage AI - API
This project was the backend developed for a Final Graduation Project (TCC). The objective of this work was to develop an academic *chatbot* that acted as a virtual assistant for users (students, professors, and course coordinators), helping them understand the requirements, procedures, and guidelines related to the internship regulations of the Federal University of Technology - Paran√° (UTFPR).

This project integrates with the OpenAI API to provide intelligent and context-aware responses to user queries, enhancing the chatbot's ability to assist users effectively.
